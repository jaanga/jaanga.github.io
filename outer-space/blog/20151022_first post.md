A mission for the Outer Space project is that thare are many cookbook examples that are short and sweet that enable you to do useful things.
In orders words, software code that goes just a bit beyond the examples you have been using to learn how to program and helps you get things done.

Of course, most of the examples in Outer Space will relate to astronomy, physics and math.

There are, however, many things that need to be done to manage a web site that go beyond the sciences.
For example, a blog is a nice thing to have on a site. So the issue is: is it possible to host a blog on GitHub with just a few lines of code?

The inspiration for the validity of this thought comes from the brilliant English 'professor' [Remy Sharp]( http://remysharp.com ). 
Remy has been hosting a blog with posts written in MarkDown and hosted on GitHub for years.

Remy's code is sophisticated and well beyond the scope of Outer Space.
We are starting with a very simple JavaScript cookbook example
