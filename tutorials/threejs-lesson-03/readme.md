## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

If everything you make takes a drawing to make it and every drawing needs a designer to create new design then making many things takes many drawings which takes a lot of designer time

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To help you create many designs on the fly


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

Designers create cool apps so normal peeps have access to unique well designed products

## Things to Try

### Drawing and Editing

* Add an extra slider bar in each menu that adds scaling in an additional direction
	* Add the appropriate box#.scale.# line to the suitable box
* Add an extra position changing slider to each menu
	* Add the appropriate variable to the box#.position.set() parameter
* Edit the allowable min and max for the boxes
* Alter the default value of the boxes 
* Add a new box with an appropriate menu
* Add your name to the menu under the title
* Change the font size from 12 point to 10 point


## Issues / Things to note

### JavaScript Console
* Function Key 12 or Control/Command Shift J brings up the JavaScript Console
* The JavaScript Console is your friend. 
* It finds the errors in you code and tells you which tile the error is on
* More info at [Google Developers]( https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/console/console-ui?hl=en )
* There are many debugging tools in your browser. You can ignore just about all of them - except the basic elements of the Console


### Back Quotes

* Lesson 2 uses the back quote - ` - to contain strings of HTML text
* Use of the back quote helps making creating and editing text much easier
* This feature is new in JavaScript 6 and only works in browsers that are up to date
* And being new almost no textbooks or guides mention its use.




## Features

* Use sliders to scale and position objects
* Rotate, Zoom and Pan
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan
