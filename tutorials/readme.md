## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

Learning how to program is an educational process. 
As with most educational processes, the task is to open up your mind to new ways of thinking.
The processes, however, may take a long time, have many false directions and much effort may end up not being that useful.
 
### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

To create a just-in-time free, open source learning system, where you learn just enough to design some useful things.

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

To get more things designed better, faster and cheaper

## The Lessons

[Three.js Lesson 1]( http://jaanga.github.io/tutorials/threejs-lesson-01/ )


## Things to Do / Road Map

* To create a dozen or so lessons that get you to the stage where you can 
	* build Three.js scripts such as [Step Up]( http://wikihouse.github.io/viewer-experiments/display-wikihouse-stepup1/display-wikihouse-stepup1-r2-phone.html )
and [Half Sheet Table]( http://opendesk.github.io/design-playground/opendesk-half-sheet-table/opendesk-half-sheet-table-app-r3.html )
	* Export the user-generated data tto SVG or DXF files  

## Hints


### Saving files

* Any work you create - especially HTML files - will most likely be kept and accessed from a server. 
Servers like to see file names with extensions - such as '.html' or '.js'. So remember too add the correct extension when saving files
* A good rule when saving files for the Internet is to have file-names-that-are-all-lower-case-with-words-separated-by-hyphens. OK?
