_Elevations View 3D Core_

***

## Concept

### Mission

* Read elevation files and create 3D display
* Get data via iframe parent, file open dialog or location.hash
* Work well in an iframe


### Vision

* TBD


## Features

* TBD


## Things you can do using this script

* Use one/two/three fingers to rotate/zoom/pan the display in 3D
	* Or left/scroll/right with your pointing device 
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Click the check box to display mesh as solid or wireframe
* Click the 'I' in the circle to go to the read me file
* Click on the title to reload the script
* Click the [Stats]( https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/ ) box in the top corner to toggle FPS / MS / MB views
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors



## Things you can do by editing the code

* Open this file: https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/terrain3/elevations/elevations-view/elevations-view-3d-core-r7.js
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor


## To Do / Wish List

* Add pokemons?
* Add placards


* Info about metres per side of map
* Accurate elevation measurement
* Link to escape iframe
* More overlays?

## Change Log


### 2016-08-01 ~ R7.2

* Looking good
* New scene with each load helps a lot
* Metadata added to all files
* Folder renamed to 'elevations view'
* Continued with variable and proceddure renaming
	* Begining to feel organized
* Cleaned up overlaying and zooming


### 2016-07-31 ~ R7

* Many changes
* Reads data embedded in elevations file
	* Converts text to variables
* Menus streamlined and cleaned up
* Continue work on logical var and procedure names



### 2016-07-28 ~ R5

* Many changes
* All objectified and in .js file.
* Zoom to radius on mesh
* Update camara and target to center of mesh
* Add sea level indicator - plain mesh at sea level
