  <h2>Credits</h2> 
    <p style="text-align: left;">The code used to display this document is sourced from the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">code</a> 
    used to display the <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/docs/" target="_blank">documentation</a><a> for Three.js 
    - a JavaScript library for 3D visualizations such as the demo included in this document.</a> </p> 
    <p>The code - which appears not to have a name - enables a multi-page document to
    be generated from files stored on GitHub.</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Allows the two frames to scroll independently.</li> 
      <li>Allows pages to be loaded without reloading the entire frame</li> 
      <li>Overcomes the inability of the GitHub server to update IFRAMES using HTML by providing
      a JavaScript routine to do this.</li> 
      <li>Provides a simple folder and file structure for creating documents of any length
      or complexity</li> 
      <li>Provides a simple wiki-like method for creating internal and external links&nbsp; </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>A GitHub 'organization' is being used to host the files because:</p> 
    <ul> 
      <li>Allows multiple people to 'own' and edit the content and code.</li> 
      <li>Provides robust version control</li> 
      <li>It's free.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <p>Editing large amounts of text in HTML using a plain text editor quickly
    becomes not fun, There are a number of WYSIWYG editors out there. A current and
    interesting tool is available at <a href="/" target="_blank" title="">shiftedit.net</a>&nbsp;and
    is the online-only IDE being used to write this text.</p>
    <p>The font used in this document is <a title="" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a> sourced from Google Web Fonts.</p>  

	<p>And, again, here is what Mr.Doob and his friends do that is wonderful: <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/" target="_blank">Three.js</a></p>
