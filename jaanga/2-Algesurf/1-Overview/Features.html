	<h1>AlgeSurf Features</h1>
	
	<p>On the following pages you have access to apps that can help you explore many different equations. 
	And then once you are happy with the resulting visualization, you can save it, create a link to it, embed it in a web page and so on.</p>

	<p>To help you, there are a number of galleries of equations and their visualizations.</p>	
	
	<p>AlgeSurf features include:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Free and open source software with a flexible license</li>
		<li>Hardware accelerated graphics in your broeswer with no plugin or download necessary</li>
		<li>Fully operational in the browser - no server required</li>
		<li>Generally, JavaScript library agnostic</li>
		<li>Realtime user interaction with zoom, pan and rotate</li>
		<li>Full <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer' target='_blank'>RESTful API</a></li>
		<li>Fast and easy editing of equations</li>
		<li>Robust equation parser with error messaging</li>
		<li>Support for a variety of materials, textures and shaders</li>
		<li>Ability to export and save data in variety of ways</li>
	</ul>
	<p>TBD:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>History of this sort of visualization</li>
		<li>Links to reference sites</li>
		<li>Other players</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>AlgeSurf Futures</h1>
	
	<p>AlgeSurf is an ongoing project. It has the opportunity of helping change the way people think about math - in a number &lt;he he> of ways.</p>
	
	<p>For example, doing math via code instead of archaic static symbolic notation offers new ways of representing and dealing math concepts.</p>
	
	<p>And here is the thing that most mathematicians have never ever considered: We can wrap animated 3D shaders around these equations. 
		Literally or figuratively, we can add hyperbole to the hyperbola. Your choice.</p>
		
	<p>Watch this space!</p>
