## Concept

[DXF]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF ) is a CAD data file format developed by Autodesk for enabling data interoperability between AutoCAD and other programs.

Viewing DXF files usually involves downloading and installing a program on your local drive or regitering withe w Web site and uploading your files to their servers.

It would be nice to have a web app that allows you to open a DXF file and display it on your screen with out having to upload and whatever.

If you want to View DXF files easily and quickly, the you have come to the right place. Or it will be quite soon.
