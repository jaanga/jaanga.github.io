# pennyShine Read Me


## Concept

[DXF]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF ) is a CAD data file format developed by Autodesk for enabling data interoperability between AutoCAD and other programs.

Viewing DXF files usually involves downloading and installing a program on your local drive or regitering withe w Web site and uploading your files to their servers.

It would be nice to have a web app that allows you to open a DXF file and display it on your screen with out having to upload and whatever.

If you want to View DXF files easily and quickly, the you have come to the right place. Or it will be quite soon.

_Parse DXF to Three.js - with experimental 'create extrusions' turned on_

## pennyShine Code

* Code we have written built upon GDS code
* Click the 'Choose File' button to load a DXF file from a local drive and view it in 3D.
* R1 is very much a work-in-progress
* The goal is to be able to take a 2D DXF file and add thickness to it along with pockets and full-depth cut-outs and create a 3D version of that file
* But for the moment it's just a work or art or a piece of crap or whatever

* 5O different DXF files - many display with errors - and we don't know why yet

## Code from [GDS Estimating]( https://github.com/gdsestimating )

* A few minor hacks added to GDS Estimating so it runs off a static host server such as GitHub Pages
