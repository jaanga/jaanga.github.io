## [Happy Valley, Hong Kong]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/happy-valley-hong-kong_16_53552_28606_4_4_512_512_.txt )

Stubbs Villa on Shiu Fai Terrace in Happy Valley. Look for the racecourse, then the cemetery. Just above are three white blocks with a swimming pool. That was us.

Bonny View House on Wong Nai Chung Road. On the oter side of the race course. Too small to spot.

The buildings on the hill sides are fun to look at. They seem to go in all directions - defying gravity


## [Mill Valley ]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/mill-valley-ca_16_10456_25299_3_3_300_300_.txt )

Eight Laurel Street. Mill Valley CA


The trees - even though they are 2D - look very 3D


## [Ressons-le-long - distant view ]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/ressons-le-long-france_11_1040_698_3_3_510_510_.txt )

The hillsides are for growing trees
The plains are for growing food in bulk.
The river valleys are for housing and small crop farming.
larger low flat areas and fill tops are forests 

## [Ressons-le-long - close view]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/ressons-le-long-france_14_8334_5598_3_3_510_510_.txt )

La Ferme de la Montage. Ressons-le-long.

This structure - dating from the 12th century - is located at the top of the least steep are of the entire hillside. 
This allows for a much easier climb for people and beasts.
It's also level enough to grow crops instead of planting trees.
The gives the structure a good view of any enemies approaching from the valley


## [San Luis Obispo]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/san-luis-obispo-ca_12_672_1617_4_3_512_384_.txt )

CalPoly, the rock at Morro Bay, Route 101 slicing through the hills. Much to look at


## [Tania's House overlooking the Chattahoochee River]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/sandy-springs-ga_14_4348_6547_3_3_510_510_.txt )

Look for the rapids on the [Chattahoochee River]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattahoochee_River ). Golf course is on one side. Tania's house is on the other side. 
Then look for the highest house with a light-colored blob - that's Tania's pool. 

The house certainly has the most significant or prominent location in the area.


## [Allison's house in Santa Barbara - distant view]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/santa-barbara-ca_14_2744_6518_3_3_510_510_.txt )

Allison's house is hard to spot. Switch to 'Google Maps Hybrid' view and you can see the street names.

The geology is lots of fun to look at.


## [Allison's house in Santa Barbara - close view]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/ace-it/elevations-view/elevations-view-ace-it-r1.html#file=https://jaanga.github.io/terrain3/elevations/elevations-data-family+friends/2224-gibraltar-road-santa-barbara-ca_17_21958_52157_3_3_510_510_.txt ) 

2224 Gibraltar Road & ???? Mountain Drive. Both houses in one view.
