_IFC View R1_

***


## Concept

* IFC is an emerging AEC standard
* [industry foundation classes]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes ) ((IFC) is an open and neutral data format for [building information modeling]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling ) (BIM).
* There is an existing mix of proprietary, closed source apps and open source apps, but most require a download and install
* The choice of FOSS web-based apps is very limited
* Mobile 3D viewing apps for IFC seem almost non-existent

_all of the above needs confirming_

### Mission

* Build lightweight IFC apps that work in your browser
* Provide interactive 3D views
* Entry level code accessible/hackable by engineers and architects
    * Build custom apps for day-to-day needs quickly and easily
* Read IFC data and directly generate 3D - no translations or intermediate formats


### Vision

* Basic IFC property editing capability
* Just-in-time viewing based on streaming or gradual loading of different layers - instead of loading everything at once.
* Ability to Redline IFC models
* 3D project management

## Features

* Choose from three examples
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload


## Things you can do using this script


* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors

* Open this file: https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/cookbook-html/demo/ifc/index.html
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor

## Issues

* 2016-11-07 ~ Need help in finding a glossary of IFC terms for dummies that loads reasonably quickly


## To Do / Wish List / Goals

* 2016-11-07 ~ Read file from your hard disk
* 2016-11-07 ~ Read file from URL

## Change Log

2016-11-09 ~ R2

The files from https://github.com/BuildingSMART/IfcScript/tree/master/Examples look like they will be a very handy resources.
There's a good number of examples with each showing a discrete facet of IFC.
Also there's a folder with images of what each example should look like.

We have taken a simple example - Wall.ifc. We can load it, parse the data and display its Geometry in 3D.
We are planning to add new examples to the menu on an ongoing basis.
With each new example added there should also be additions and enhancements to the capabilities of the reader/interpreter

Unfortunately it looks like there are many style for creating IFC files.
The Buildingsmart files were created with a tool tiled 'Geometry Gym'.
These files do not seen to create data in the same way that Revit creates IFC data.
Thus the display of none of the other examples has been enhanced by the added capabilities in R2.

This is all part of a learning process.
The important thing will be to keep the code readable and simple so that it will be easy for people too adapt the code to new situations.


* Add opensourceBIM/IFC-files example: Wall.ifc
    * Display wall as a 3D mesh
* Add Stanford.edu example: BIMhouse_ARK_info4
    * Some of the geometry displays

### 2016-11-07 ~ R1

* Opens, reads, parses and displays IFC files
* Three examples
    * Hello Wall
        * [Building Smart - Examples]( http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/implementation/ifc4-implementation/helpful-examples )
    * Hello House
        * Still at very early stage of interpretation - date held in library blocks needs extrusion, position and rotation
        * [Building Smart - Examples]( http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/implementation/ifc4-implementation/helpful-examples )
    * rst_advanced_sample_project.ifc
        * 15K entities - takes a while to load
* Reads and displays in 3D polylines, polyloops and coordinates
* Reads and displays on menu some unformatted project meta-data
* First commit
* Add Read Me
