### [Ricoh Theta Sandbox]( http://jaanga.github.io/demo/gn/ricoh-theta-sandbox/index.html )

Images from the [Ricoh Theta]( https://theta360.com/en/ ) work very well as the textures that can be used to create [sky spheres]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybox_(video_games) )

Supports the following:

* Rotate = one finger / left mouse
* Zoom = two fingers / scroll wheel
* Pan = three fingers / right mouse
* Rotation = press space bar
* Previous / Next image = left / right cursor keys

### Things to Do / Road Map

* Add your own images
* Upload images to Imgur and then call them from the app
* Change the speed of the rotation
* Video capability
* Slideshow capability
* Blend in 3D objects
