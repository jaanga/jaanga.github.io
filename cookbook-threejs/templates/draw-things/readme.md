## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

* Examples in 3D need 'assets' in order to demo what they are meant to show. Assets are time-consuming to produce and are often too simple to show sufficient quality 


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* Create JavaScript that create interesting assets

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->
