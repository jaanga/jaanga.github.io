_Mars Heightmap_

A [Mars repository]( https://github.com/jaanga/mars ) has been created on Jaanga.

The repository is starting to be populated. See the [Mars Read Me]( http://jaanga.github.io/mars/ ) for details.

Files have been copied over from [Jaanga Terrain R2]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-r2/viewers/index.html ) which will be deprecated.

The Mars Voyager has been much improved. 
It's now titled [Mars Voyager Gamer]( http://jaanga.github.io/mars/voyager/gamer/dev/ ) following the pattern set by [Moon Voyager Gamer]( http://jaanga.github.io/moon/voyager/gamer/dev ).
The script still has a number of issues which will be fixed in the near future.

A number of utilities have been brought over from the Moon utilities folder and updated.
 
A start have been made on building a 'Mars Rover' which should operate in a similar manner to [Moon Rover]( http://jaanga.github.io/moon/rover-mobile/ ).
