## Preface
This paper is an ongoing effort.

It is closer to being a proposal for a dissertation than to a dissertation.

If there is interest a mailing list could be developed for this topic. ;-)

Introduction
It seems self-evident to me that the electronic mailing list is currently the fastest and most effective way of advancing human knowledge.

Posed as a question: Is the electronic mailing list is currently the fastest and most effective way of advancing human knowledge?

This paper is an attempt to substantiate the above assertion.

An e-mail mailing list is comprised of the following functionality:
Correspondence is pushed to all members of the list
Usually the correspondence is passed via email
A group of members is selected - often by invitation only - given that invitations usually are not be unreasonably withheld
A history of all the correspondence available at all times by electronic means
The mailing list as a tool and enabler of an intellectual discourse
The mailing list as a management tool.

Other interesting questions
Is a mailing list better than a conference call?
Why is a mailing list better than normal e-mail?
How can you use a mailing list to help start a company?
Which is better a meeting or a mailing list?

What is the context?

Initial Thoughts
The book and the article are perhaps the best ways of recording, transferring and communicating knowledge from one human to another. Within this domain are included online works such as Wikipedia.

Thus in terms of disseminating data points to the largest number of recipients the book and article are the highest volume transmitters of information.

One can assume that the author of the work has full understanding of the domain and thus for all the data points that are in the work. But has the reader/the recipient actually acquired the knowledge embedded in the book or article?

The only way of knowing whether the data has been successfully transmitted is if the reader uses or re-appropriates that information in some way - perhaps just to write a review on Amazon.com or in an email to a friend.

Every time a reviewer writes a note the original work is essentially re-performed in the author’s brain. Of course the reviewer does not remember every word, but actually synthesizes some abbreviation of work. Since what is in the reviewer’s brain is not identical to the original work it must be considered a new work.

If something is new then this must indicate the creation of new data or information.

Each time new information is created then knowledge is advanced.

**
Mailing list as an implementation of the Socratic method

**
We now have three things the book, the reviewer and the reader.

The reader is now forced into making not just a buy or not buy the book decision (and accept the author’s argument) but the reader also the make a meta judgment regarding the validity of the reviewer’s position.

There’s is the author’s point of view. There is the reviewer’s point of view regarding the author’s point of view then there is the readers point of view on the the reviewers and author’s point of view.

Each triple cause a judgment. Each judgment represents a tiny/minuscule recorded advancement of knowledge.

Each triple is a performance of the work at hand.

The mailing list is like an assembly of multiple triples.

There is the topic of the mailing list then each thread and then each post in the thread.

The topic is the equivalent of the book, the thread is a chapter or section and the post the reviewer’ question or answer regarding the item. Your job is to decide whether the post you are reading is a valid response to the topic or not.

Each time a post is read and a decision is taken about the correctness of the post and a new post is drafted in response then knowledge has been advanced.

**

Tied up in all this is the notion of Getting Things Done.

The reason a person posts a question to a mailing list is because they are trying to do something and they need help. I cannot help but think that there connections to David Allen’s Getting Things Done ideas - and will explore this in more detail.

From Amazon.com Product Description:

Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture addresses what may be the single most important question facing all kinds of performance today. What is the status of live performance in a culture dominated by mass media?

Since its first appearance, Philip Auslander's ground-breaking book has helped to reconfigure a new area of study. Looking at specific instances of live performance such as theatre, rock music, sport, and courtroom testimony, Liveness offers penetrating insights into media culture, suggesting that media technology has encroached on live events to the point where many are hardly live at all. In this new edition, the author thoroughly updates his provocative argument to take into account new digital and media technologies, and cultural, social and legal developments.

In tackling some of the last great shibboleths surrounding the high cultural status of the live event, this book will continue to shape discussion and to provoke lively debate on a crucial artistic dilemma: what is live performance and what can it mean to us now?

## Comparisons with Verbal/Oral Communication

As of this writing, I do not know whether to call this stuff verbal communication or oral communication were merely orality.

As of this writing, I am in the process of discovering the enormity of the difference between oral and written communication. Or, perhaps, to be more precise I am beginning to discover the research and the scholarly thinking regarding the differences.

I will look to Marshall McLuhan and his mentor Harold Inness for the initial guidance into this topic.

Apart from the above, I also plan to explore two scenarios that I have not “tested through controlled scientific studies - but primarily include clinical observation, introspection and anecdote—methods that are largely regarded as inconclusive by the modern field of psychology.”
Preferred Media as a Personality Trait
The first difference is that some people seem to “do better” at one of these media over the other.

I have for some time felt that some people I interact with are primarily “verbal” people and some people I interact with are primarily “writing” people.

The CEOs and managers I know like to talk. The engineers and technical people like to write.

The talkers will ask to phone you or meet with you. The writers tend to text or email you.

Most people seem to slide back and forth - enjoying being talkers at some time and writers at other times. But each these people tend to spend more time in one mode over the other.

I seem to spend more time writing and reading than talking and listening. Is this by choice or by circumstance? Hard to know.

Not only to people prefer on media over the other but they tend to deliver quite different content. This thought is new to me and I am exploring it by reading up on Marshall McLuhan and others.

The thing I am learning about the fastest right now is the depth of information that is transmitted orally.

Given the depth of data that is being transmitted in a meeting, I can’t if anyone has ever gratuitously sent me a link to a “great set of minutes” or to a video of a really fun AGM or even pointed towards a life-changing annual report.

The CEO might have caused millions of dollars to be spent on preparing an annual report by a chance cartoon drawn by a high-school drop-out can easily get more hits than the report.

The CEO is attuned to orality, meetings and phone calls. The dropout attuned to memes, words and images. On the Internet the dropout gets the hits.

I am not certain if this is a fair comparison. Here is what I am certain of.

Let us say that you are a CEO or a manager operates in an organization that has significant technology issues, that has significant involvement with the Internet, deals with academia and professionals qualified by some sort of licencing or advanced degree

If you then manage this organization by meetings, phone and email then you may not be accessing even half the knowledge and wisdom of your organization.

Without a venue for the “writing” people to express themselves in a collective, recordable, collaborative and actionable manner, you are operating your organization as if you are the tribal chieftain.

White papers and PowerPoint presentations do not count. There has to be a venue in written where there is actual dialog, give and take, thesis and antithesis, proposal and rebuttal in written form.

## A mailing list is a good place to start.

There should be at least one mailing list should be open to all. It can be by invitation only. but anyone can request an invitation and such invitation shall not be capriciously withheld.  Members can be anonymous.

Other mailing list could be more private, but the public list should always be closely monitored by management. All lists should be moderated
Issues when Oral and Written Methods are Combined
Sometimes one ends up communicating partially by email and partially orally in a live meet-up.

This screws things up for the later historian because there tend to be maddening gaps in the written conversation as the later historian has no access to the dialog.

Comparisons with Digitally-Assisted Oral Communication
One cannot talk about oral communication without bring up the myriad of digital assistants that have been produced. Technologies such as thos listed below will be explored for relevance.

Telephone
Mobile Phone
Voicemail
Conference Calls
Skype
Google Voice
Webex
LiveScribe
VoiceBase
Radio/podcast
Television/ streaming video

Issues with these methods include:
Not Asynchronous
Everybody has to be there
Everybody has to be able to speak coherently in the default language
The great thoughts and words disappearing into the oblivion almost as soon as they are uttered
Some of these losses can be mitigated if the meeting is recorded
Many more of these losses can be eliminated if the meeting is transcribed into text.

The over-arching difference between a conference call and a mailing list is still the difference between verbal and written communication.

The Future of Electronic Communication
Anything on the Internet could last 10,000 years. Perhaps even forever

The conversation is recorded.

Digitally Assisted Writing Communication
Benefits of Writing
Generally
Digitally-Assisted Writing Benefits
When considering the many forms of communication, written communication lends itself most easily to editing and re-appropriating / mashing-up.

The benefits of written communication include :
The easiest to transmit
Fastest to be consumed/read/understood/acquired
Least biased nuanced
Easiest to preserve/process

collaboration tool
asynchronous / time and location independent - voice could be too
Internet Benefits
The Internet is a assemblage of graphic, oral and written communication.

The Internet allows us to learn from the learning (mistakes?) of others.

Learning from the mistakes of others. Perhaps includes some Schadenfreude. Or even humor: Beckett: 'Nothing is funnier than unhappiness.'

Informed By Mailing List Apps
This paper is primarily based on my personal experience using several mailing lists including Mailman and Google Groups.

Yahoo groups, Autodesk  mailing list, LotusNotes / Major domo

Webex, Facebook, Twitter

Mailing List Features & Benefits

Who Posts

Peers to be judged by - equals - rarely teachers and students

Anonymity in reading and anonymity in posting

Like-minded people
Informed responses

Etiquette
A consciousness of the collective
should not ask favors

What do they post
Conversations are threaded - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading

Multiple threads on the same topic

Tendency to keep people on topic

How do they view
user defined addresses / subscription

view as email / digest / on web
sort by date

When do they view?
Asynchronous http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning

Leveraging the benefits of email
Speed of transmission
Timeliness - dialog can take place as fast as people can type
Push aspect - most important. On a blog you have to wait until the person comes to the web site. With a mailing list the message is sent to all users.

How is it managed?
Moderators
message clean-up

Topics are controlled

spam free

moderation

Apache
There are numerous benefits of using mailing lists over private communication. Mailing lists are a shared resource where others can also learn from common mistakes and as a community we all grow together. This discussion also builds a searchable knowledge-base. Doing off-list discussion is not efficient: only one person hears the answers and it will cause the volunteers to become burnt out.

Differentiators / Compare with Other Digital Media

Traditional Email
see Gmail, Outlook
Not easy for recipients newly-added to a thread to acquire the full history of the dialog
Not easy to graze over past threads
Not easy to gain access to other people’s threads

Online Forums
see phpBB
On-line forums are the logical follow-on to mailing lists when there are sufficient users and topics
Slightly less interactive than the mailing list. You tend to have to go to the Forum whereas with a mailing list the messages come to you.

Online Chat
see Twitter??
Facebiik
iRC
Blog Comments
see WordPress, Blogger
popular posts can have hundreds of comments making it difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff.
