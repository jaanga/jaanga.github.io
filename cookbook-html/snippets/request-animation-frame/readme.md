## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

    Our web app feels laggy on low-end machines because it does a lot of GPU-side work.  
    In extreme cases, we'd like the app to detect poor performance at run time, and automatically drop into a simplified state.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

Looking for something that just pops out a simple number telling me that a script is running slowly. 
This should be part of the script and have no need to access the console.


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->
