_GitHub API Users Events_

***

## Concept

### Mission

* To demonstrate that the GitHub API is accessible by beginner to intermediate coders
* To demonstrate that you can do many nice things with the GitHub API without having to use a server or a terminal window or localhost
* To enable you to see what your peeps have been working on and playing with


### Vision

* Create buddy lists that talk to each other
* Find ways of showing more fun things to do with coding and sharing


## Features


* Uses the GitHub API to gather a user's organizations, gists, repos and events
	* Organizations: displays title and description
	* Gists: displays title and data
	* Repositiries - displays title, data & if forked
* Select user from drop-down list or by text input
	* Displays user's profile data
* Display all ten pages of user events one-by-one or all at once
* List user events in an informative manner



## Wish List

* List languages of repos
* To make lists of orgs and users available via Gist
	* Select using location.hash
* Add more users
* Center on page
* Make menu and content scroll independently??
* Add an issues as blog posts capability
* Add scaled thumbnails to repos and orgs 
* Put the scale div inside a fixed height container << no help


## Things you can do using this script

* Select GitHub members from the list
* Enter the name of a GitHub user you know in the input box
* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors

> It’s a lot simpler to have a discussion based on something written down. It’s easy to talk endlessly and in circles about a problem if nothing is ever put to text. The simple act of writing down a proposed solution means everyone has a concrete idea that can be argued about and iterated upon.

> Consider the process of writing the Readme for your project as the true act of creation. This is where all your brilliant ideas should be expressed. This document should stand on its own as a testament to your creativity and expressiveness. The Readme should be the single most important document in your codebase; writing it first is the proper thing to do.
