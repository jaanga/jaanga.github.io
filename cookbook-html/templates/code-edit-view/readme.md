## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

Enable GitHub read me Markdown files to be read as HTML and displayed as web pages

Loads an HTML file provided in the location hash in a split view showing both raw code and rendered HTML.

Defaults to loading the local index.html file.

Becomes wonderfully complicated when called upon to load itself - as shown above.


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->



## Things to Do / Road Map
